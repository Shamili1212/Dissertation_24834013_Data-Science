Urban road traffic is a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in cities, with Greater Manchester’s transport sector alone accounting for over 38% of CO₂ output (Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2019, 2020). On Oxford Road, one of the busiest routes in Manchester, congestion and emissions have a direct impact on both public health and environmental sustainability. Traditional monitoring methods such as roadside cameras and sparse air-quality stations provide valuable insights but are limited by cost, coverage gaps, and privacy concerns. Recent studies have demonstrated that seismic signals can act as a proxy for anthropogenic activity, suggesting a scalable and cost-effective alternative for traffic monitoring (Lecocq et al., 2020) .
This project investigates the feasibility of seismic data as an indicator of road traffic activity by integrating heterogeneous datasets. A Raspberry Shake seismometer was combined with Drakewell camera counts, DEFRA air-quality readings, and Open-Meteo weather data between December 2024 and March 2025. A baseline Linear Regression model was compared against Random Forest regression models, trained on seismic features to estimate quarter-hourly traffic counts. The Random Forest approach, particularly when incorporating air-quality and weather covariates, demonstrated stronger predictive capability than the baseline. Evaluation using standard metrics such as R², MAE, RMSE, and MSE confirmed the robustness of the model, including analyses with stratified vehicle categories.
This report covers the preprocessing of datasets, the construction and evaluation of predictive models, and the analysis of traffic–pollution relationships. The findings demonstrate that seismic data provide a viable signal for estimating traffic intensity, with improved reliability when combined with air-quality and weather data. Limitations include the winter-only dataset and the need for seasonal and multi-site validation, which future work should address.
